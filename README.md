Hi there 🖖, 

I had undergraduate in Bioinformatics at the Freie University of Berlin and have work experience as a Data Analyst. I am now making a switch in my career to become a Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer. You'll find my current status on my machine learning journey below:

🌌 I'm currently working on: <b> A web app to detect user-uploaded workout videos and give feedback based on their performance </b>

🎍 I'm currently learning: <b> Neural Networks using TensorFlow </b>

📚 I'm currently reading: <b> The Elements of Statistical Learning, The Lean Startup </b>

🌊 What I want to learn & do next: <b> chatGPT API, kaggle projects, pursue a master's in Data Science </b>
